# Altium-Designer-Libraries

-Contains a list of parts I routinely use in designs. 
-I will be adding to this list as and when I work with new components.
-Every part is provided a Mfg name and # so there is easy traecability to the mfg part with the right footprint.
-Some parts like switches, relays, passives are to be treated as general purpose parts and linking to actual manufacturer data 
should be done at time of finalizing PCB project.
